<h1>Zhambra - God of Friendship and Loyalty</h1>

   <p>Prayed to for:<br />
   Protection of friendships, loyalty and holy vows, orcish bloodbrother-rituals, protection in
   battle for loyal ones.</p>

   <p>Personality:<br />
   Friendly, intelligent, sympathetic, honorable, but he knows no mercy for those betraying him or
   others, very strict in his behavior.</p>

   <p>Figure:<br />
   Appears as a young, friendly noble. Sometimes appears in shiny armor and helps loyal soldiers
   out of dangerous situations. Sometimes acts through other persons, and founds many friendships
   even on battlefields.</p>

   <p>Likes/Dislikes:<br />
   Likes loyalty and friendships, honorable persons. Dislikes &quot;dirty&quot; behavior.</p>

   <p>Followers:<br />
   The followers of Zhambra are righteous and loyal ones who believe in honor and law. They often
   try to rescue others, and fight against the evil. Zhambra is worshipped by nobles and knights,
   paladins, and many soldiers. They believe that when they die, the number of their friends are
   counted, and when they have one good friend or a loyal one(alive or dead), then Zhambra will
   take their hand and lead them to paradise. If they have no friend, then Zhambra will lead them
   to be reborn, and make friends. If they were bad people, and willingly betrayed others, Zhambra
   will throw an iron glove to their feet that they must pick up. It is told that many of those
   people stand in Zhambra&#39;s hall for a long time, not taking the glove in pure fear. If they
   pick up the glove, they must put it on, and a sword will appear in it. They will appear on an
   eternal battlefield until they die in honor. Then they are lead to the god&#39;s hall again, and
   if they have learned loyalty, they will be either reborn to make friends, or if they already
   have some, led into paradise by the God.</p>
