<h1>Findari - Goddess of Air</h1>

<?php cap(F); ?>
<p>indari is the goddess of the element Air. Kind in person, she gave change to the world - for the better or the worse but that is always a matter of perspective. It is not in Findari's nature to be compulsory but she is known as a friendly goddess without bad intentions. Although, those who do not understand her ways won't regard the devastation of storms she brings as a chance to start anew, but as sheer destruction.
If Findari ever takes on a form, she is dressed mostly in light blue and appears as an ageless blond-haired woman, dancing where others might sob. Music and fine arts are her preference, as long as they do not fall under rules but are used to express one's thoughts and feelings.</p>

<h2>Followers</h2>
<p>Findari's believers were always few, since she did never care much about temples and being
worshipped. It is said that she still chooses some rare followers by herself, who then become
visionairs or wandering prophets, or even great bards and artists. As all elder gods, he is worshipped at the Temple of the Five, east of Galmair. 
There is also the Chapel of the Five, east of the Kantabi Desert, where the name of the Five is held in honour. 
Sailors of Runewick are known to pray to her, but more in fear of storms than true admiration.</p>

<h2>Findos - Month of Fine Arts</h2>

<p>Findos is one of the main harvesting months around Runewick and Galmair. As the peasants are busy working during Findos, few festivities are known in this time of the year. And Findari is fine with that, as freedom from reoccuring obligations matters more to her than being worshipped.</p>

<h2>Sign of the Zodiac - The Elegant Falcon</h2>

<p>The Falcons are full of bold beauty and attract alot of spectators. They love music, painting, and other arts. Many various wishes slumber under their thin shell of reason.
They are artistically talented and inventive. An Elegant Falcon tends to be very curious and sometimes impertinent - they can afford it. Their might be fickle, but one thing they never are: boring.</p>
