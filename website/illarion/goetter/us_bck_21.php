   <p>Followers:<br />
   Many follow the honorable Malach&iacute;n. Soldiers and knights pray for protection in battles, hunters
   for a good hunt and protection while hunting, paladins for protection and a powerful fist
   against the evil. Some more honorable orc tribes pray to him to ensure food from hunts and
   protection in defending the tribe&#39;s territory. Followers of Malach&iacute;n believe, that when they
   die in honor, they will be led to the door of a great castle / war tent, and there will be a big
   feast for them, and Malach&iacute;n will ask them what they did in life. Then they can tell the story
   of their life, and if it is a honorable and true story, they are invited to sit with him at the
   table with the great heroes for that evening. The next morning, they will stand up in arms, and
   fight a honorable battle against Moshran&#39;s demons, and they will stand up in the evening
   when they fall. In the evenings, there will be feasts again, with listening to newcomer&#39;s
   stories, and much other talk. If a soldier shows much honor in these battles, he will be sent
   back to the world to assist righteous paladins or soldiers (sometimes known ones, or even orc
   shamans) in battle or as a spiritual mentor. Sometimes, a fighter or even a great hero will be
   sent back to be reborn to fulfill a righteous purpose in times when heroes are needed. Doom
   await those who are liars or have lived an unhonorable life and dare to face Malach&iacute;n. They are
   denied to sit next to the God but instead their soul is condemned to wander the sphere between
   the worlds. Never to enter the realm of the undead nor to be reborn. Cherga is know to look out
   for those with her mercyless gaze to punish them in a way they deserve.</p>
