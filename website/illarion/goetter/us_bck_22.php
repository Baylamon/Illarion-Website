<h1>Irmorom - God of Trade and Craftsmanship</h1>

   <p>Prayed to for:<br />
   Good business, making of things, protection when working. God of most Blacksmiths, other
   craftsmen, merchants and dwarves.</p>

   <p>Personality:<br />
   Neutral, honorable, good natured, sociable, talkative</p>

   <p>Figure:<br />
   Appears as rich dressed gray skinned and haired ( as if made of stone ) man or dwarf wearing a
   hammer or a plain dressed man with an apron.</p>

   <p>Likes/Dislikes:<br />
   Likes Law, Justice, gold and riches, business and craftsmanship. Dislikes thieves. Seldom
   refuses a nice beer.</p>

   <p>Followers:<br />
   Most dwarves, businessmen and crafters, i.e. blacksmiths, pray to Irmorom. They believe that in
   life, they will be rewarded for their doings with riches and money, and they pray for
   enchantment of crafted things, for a good trade, riches, and things like this. When they die,
   they will be brought to a big mountain, with an entrance and the dead ones hailing them. They
   will be lead deep into that mountain, and there they must show Irmorom what they can make. If
   they do a good job, they will be rewarded with a very good life in great wealth. If not, they
   will be laughed at , and sent back to be reborn and learn more. If they impress the god, they
   will be granted some power too.</p>
