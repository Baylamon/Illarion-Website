<h1>Moshran - God of Blood and Bones</h1>

   <p>Prayed to for:<br />
   Big battles, sharp blades, power and wealth without taking care of something. Orcish war god.
   Power for necromantic spells or undead beings.</p>

   <p>Personality:<br />
   In most places just known as the Blood-God or Bone-Lord, people prefer not to call him by his
   real name. Mighty, powerful, war-loving and blood lusty. Shows some hidden wisdom and sometimes
   rough humor. Helps strong evil people; his regime is dominated by pain and violence.</p>

   <p>Figure:<br />
   Appears as a strong, tall orcish warlord, his clothes and weapons drenched in blood, ore as an
   old Lich who teaches necromancers.</p>

   <p>Likes/Dislikes:<br />
   Likes good battles, even with unfair methods. Expects unquestioned loyalty and living flesh as a
   sacrificial offering. Dislikes weaknesses of all kind.</p>

   <p>Followers:<br />
   Moshran is the &quot;Blood God&quot; of several blood-thirsty orcish war tribes, who takes
   living sacrifices. His altairs are often drenched in blood. His followers are few, evil beings.
   Their rituals are always bloody. Sometimes, an evil orc shaman or warlord prays to Moshran,
   telling the other orcs of the tribe to sacrifice the God under another name. Moshran priests
   often hide their identities, because they will be attacked by the most righteous people. Evil
   necromancers call Moshran the &quot;Bone Lord&quot;, because he grants them knowledge and power
   - for a horrible price. Unlike the followers of Cherga, they are not satisfied with immortality
   - they want power in eternity. Moshran teaches the most worthy and powerful evil ones dark,
   runeless and unholy rituals. When a Moshran follower dies, Moshran will count the numbers of
   that ones victims, and his effectivity. If the person was &quot;worthy&quot; enough, he will
   perhaps be sent back as a powerful undead (most are slain by some powerful heroes), and if not,
   he enslaves the soul to do minor services. Some of these &quot;servants&quot; have become
   powerful demon-like creatures over some time, and proved worthy to roam the world again, or have
   become Moshran&#39;s helpers. Amongst his helpers are always intrigues and plans to overthrow
   the ones in a higher position. The soul of those who fail Moshran is forfeit. It is said that he
   will brand them with his claws of death marking them as his alone. They may try to hide or seek
   protection, but to no avail. He doesn&#39;t search for them as time playes in his hands.
   Eventually they will stand in front of him and their soul will be tortured in eternity to give
   pleasure to the Blood God.</p>
