<h1>Oldra - Goddess of Life and Fertility</h1>

   <p>Prayed to for:<br />
   Growth of grain and food, birth of children, healing, protection and advice.</p>

   <p>Personality:<br />
   Mother figure, wise and helpful, good-natured. Often helps women.</p>

   <p>Figure:<br />
   Appears as a blue dressed, stout and elder woman. Often portrayed as the so called
   Bradamen-tree, known for its longevity.</p>

   <p>Likes/Dislikes:<br />
   Dislikes greedy and selfish persons; especially likes gardens, arable land and domestic animals,
   but also protects other kinds of living beings. Prefers good meals.</p>

   <p>Followers:<br />
   Oldra&#39;s followers, as the followers of Ushara in the former times, are cooks, peasants and
   many halflings. They believe in the &quot;All-Mother&quot; Oldra, the one who blesses the
   gardens, fields and domestic animals, newborn children, bearing mothers and birth itself. Most
   of her priests are female, who serve the Goddess from early years on into high age. They think
   that when they die, they will be brought to a big garden gate. Oldra stands at this gate,
   welcomes them, and if they have been good, they can enjoy the wonders of the never ending
   garden, and meet old and new friends in it - if not, they are allowed a rest, and send back to
   be reborn with a new name to make a good sense of their life.</p>
