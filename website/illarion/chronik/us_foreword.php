<h1>The Chronicle of Illarion</h1>

<h2>The beginning: End of the old era</h2>

<p>A powerful sorcerer with name Mordak al Kharud obtains the rule over nearly all human
tribes. But he can't rest content with what he has attained. And so he began to enlarge
his rule beyond the humans territory. He furthered the mistrust and the prejudices the
humans had against all other races and began to conquer territorys which the humans
hadn't a right on.</p>

<p>He's a legend figur - he gave orders, however a few have ever seen him. He was a hard
sovereign, not a purpose cruel, but extrem hard and cold - blooded, a wire - puller so
to say, who interested hardly anything else than might.</p>

<p>The other free folks build up an alliance to appose them selfs to this assault. In
the end his empire was destroyed and he self was killed.</p>

<p>The humans folk, who was united only by his will and might, broke apart. All over
occured smaller wars and fights. The humans tried to escape from the other folks anger
and with their flight they caused chaos and revolt where ever they appeared. A general
recession of values, law and order was noticed. Bad crops contributed to this critical
situation.</p>

<h2>The beginning: Colonization of the island</h2>

<p>On the search for territories, which were exempt from this anarchy, a lot made up to
keep their existence. A few of them discovered this island and set their foot on a
world, which were exempt from the revolt and the central conflikt.</p>

<p>The island was fertile and it was rich of minerals - jewels and mines of ore, which
were even found on the surface.</p>

<p>By this time only Lizzards lived in the territorial waters of the island.</p>

<p>Rests of an earlier colonisation were found, the mummy's ruins and the ruins of a
lighthouse. But nobody knew more about it.</p>

<h2>The beginning: A new era</h2>

<p>The endeavour of a few of this new settlers was it to treat everyone in the same way,
therewith to left the past behind and forget the anger against the others. But there
were also others, who can't forget what had happend.</p>

<p>Independent of this, for all, the moment they enter this island, was a new beginning.
And so they called it the year one after Mordak al Kharuds break down to remind them,
what they had left behind.</p>

<h2>The beginning: A settlement arises</h2>

<p>First buildings were build up, a small village arised. Eliza was the first, who used
the new beginning and together with the newcomers she built the shop as the villages
center. Further buildings came up later.</p>

<p>The mages tower as guard - and defence Tower, a workshop for the population and a
wooden provisional pub in the north (which doesn't stayed till today).</p>

<p>The Grey Light and the Grey Rose built up the library, the Grey Light later the
todays pub, the trademan of Silverstar their small shop, shrines for the gods were built
up and in the last years the Seahorse Inn and Silverbrand, the dwarfentown in the
underground arised.</p>

<p>The village growed and growed, became a little town, get further streets, lanes and
residential building dwellings. The history went on. Personalities steped into the foot
- lights of public live and disappeared out of it. Guilds were established, announced
them and sank in the disregard for the great history. Some names were often to hear,
others stay in secrecy apart from from a few moments. And obviously there was the mass
of folk, which nobody ever heared anything of.</p>

<h2>The project</h2>

<p>Years past by, the beginnings faded into oblivion.</p>

<p>Notes and knowledge got lost. To prevent this, inhabitants of Trol's Bane came
together to explore their history.</p>

<p>The library of the Grey Light proved to be a mine. After all the beginnings of the
settlement stayed in darkness. It seems that the importance of collecting knowlege for
the future was first intantional with the construction of th elibrary. Publications and
notices on the shops wall were collected and kept in an archives.</p>

<p>The following chronicle of Trol's Bane arised out of this archives.</p>
