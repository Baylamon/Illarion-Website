<h1>Illarion Game Rules</h1>

<?php Page::cap('I'); ?>
<p>n order to promote a positive game experience for every player, there are 
a few guidelines and rules that we ask players to follow. Doing so will 
provide the best possible roleplay adventure for all.</p>

<p>The most important principle in Illarion though is:</p>

<p><b>We play with, not against each other.</b></p>

<p>We have set a recommended minimum age of 16 years old. Players have to be 
able to handle certain themes and content within the game with maturity.</p>

<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

<?php Page::cap('R'); ?>
<p>ules are important to create a good roleplay atmosphere. But no rules can
describe how players should behave with each other. This code of conduct shows
what kind of game climate and game culture we would like to create in Illarion.
Because it is important to have a set of guidelines which shows players how to
be respectful, considerate and to be lenient with one another.</p>

<?php Page::cap('I'); ?>
<p>Illarion is a true roleplaying game. Your character is not your avatar in
another world and his gain and loss is not yours. Separate yourself from your
character and let him have flaws and commit mistakes. Players commit mistakes
once in a while, too. Be lenient towards the mistakes of other players, nobody
is perfect, not even you. If you cannot stand the behaviour of another player,
leave him alone and contact a gamemaster. Have faith in the fact that no one
wants to harm your fun on purpose, likewise, you must not want to spoil anyone's
fun. Consider whether everything you do in game is also fun for other players or
just for you alone.</p>

<?php Page::cap('I'); ?>
<p>llarion is based on cooperative playing, even if characters may be foes, the
players shall continue the tale of Illarion hand in hand. To battle each other
is in vain, this holds for the Illarion staff, too. It consists of volunteers
that manage a free game in their spare time, without being perfect, just like
you. Respect and common courtesy are as important as good communication; 
helpful word has commonly more effect than a thousand complaints. The staff
does its share to shape the world of Illarion, but the major share is done by
the players. The tales and adventures in the game as well as the way of
communication on the boards and in the chat are influenced by players just like
you. Please contribute actively to maintain an atmosphere of respect and
considerateness that attracts roleplayers from all around the world.</p>

<h2> Common Game Rules </h2>

<p>1. Every player is allowed one account. You are responsible for the 
actions of your characters, regardless if an unauthorized person gained
access to your account.</p>

<p>2. If two players wish to share an internet connection, they must
contact the Illarion staff. </p>

<p>3. Names of characters must fit into a medieval fantasy world and 
also to their race. Well known, historical, mythological, or names 
that are offensive are not permitted, nor are titles (earned in-game).</p>

<p>4. Races that are allowed to play are limited to those that are 
able to be chosen from in the character creation process in your 
account system. Mixed-race characters are not allowed. A gamemaster's
permission is needed for all magical and divine interventions as well
as supernatural properties that cannot be realised by the engine and
affect the game world or other players.</p>

<p>5. While the game engine permits and limits some actions, players 
must adapt characters to the “realism” in Illarion, including any 
behaviors that one would exhibit in a medieval fantasy world. Do not
ignore NPC’s or disregard injuries. If struck down or injured, act out
the injuries until health is recovered.</p>

<p>6. It is not permitted for two characters of one player to mix or
interact with each other. One’s characters cannot know each other, nor
can they exchange items with each other or through a middleman. It is 
not allowed to log in with two characters at the same time.</p>

<p>7. Players are not allowed to use out of character (OOC) information 
that they have obtained, but that their character has not. Decisions of
characters should not be influenced by OOC information.</p>

<p>8. Language of characters should match that of a medieval fantasy world.
Leet speak (e.g. u got pwn3d) and modern expressions are not permitted. 
Senseless messages and typing in all capital letters is not permitted.</p>

<p>9. Actions of characters (e.g. fighting, crafting) should be accompanied 
with emotes. Emotes describe perceivable actions and states, not opinions,
thoughts or feelings.</p>

<p>10. Power emotes, or ones that force actions of other characters, are not permitted.</p>

<p>11. Characters must have a valid and traceable reason to attack other characters.
Also, attacking a character after they are resurrected (res-killing) is not allowed.</p>

<p>12. The portrayal of extreme violence and x-rated actions are not permitted 
(e.g. sexual content, glorifying violence, and brutal or perverse acts).</p>

<p>13. All contents that hurt the ideals or moralities of other players are not allowed.</p>

<p>14. Harassment, threats or insults, racist and sexist statements will not be tolerated
in-game, on the forums, or in the chat. It is not acceptable to answer a rule violation 
with one of your own. If you find a rule violation unbearable, please contact the 
Illarion staff.</p>

<p>15. The willful use of game errors (bugs) is forbidden. If a bug is founded, it 
should be reported to the Illarion staff, on the bugtracker.</p>

<p>16. Gamemasters keep the peace in-game and host player events. They also run the 
in-game factions of Cadomyr, Runewick and Galmair. All requests that affect the in-game 
world should be directed to gamemasters.</p>

<p>17. On the forums, the creation of senseless or off-topic posts is not allowed.</p>

<p>18. The usage of additional programs that could influence the behaviour 
of the game are prohibited.</p>

<p>19. The sources of Java software and of the server are released and available 
for public review. All other content is property of Illarion and is therefore 
protected by copyright. It is not allowed to use this content without permission 
of the Illarion society.</p>
