<h1>Illarion Game Rules</h1>

<?php Page::cap('I'); ?>
<p>n order to promote a positive game experience for every player, there are 
a few guidelines and rules that we ask players to follow. Doing so will 
provide the best possible roleplay adventure for all.</p>

<p>The most important principle in Illarion though is:</p>

<p><b>We play with, not against each other.</b></p>

<p>We have set a recommended minimum age of 16 years old. Players have to be 
able to handle certain themes and content within the game with maturity.</p>

<h2>Code of Conduct</h2>

<?php Page::cap('R'); ?>
<p>ules are important to create a good roleplay atmosphere. But no rules can
describe how players should behave with each other. This code of conduct shows
what kind of game climate and game culture we would like to create in Illarion.
Because it is important to have a set of guidelines which shows players how to
be respectful, considerate and to be lenient with one another.</p>

<?php Page::insert_go_to_top_link(); ?>

<?php Page::cap('I'); ?>
<p>Illarion is a true roleplaying game. Your character is not your avatar in
another world and his gain and loss is not yours. Separate yourself from your
character and let him have flaws and commit mistakes. Players commit mistakes
once in a while, too. Be lenient towards the mistakes of other players, nobody
is perfect, not even you. If you cannot stand the behaviour of another player,
leave him alone and contact a gamemaster. Have faith in the fact that no one
wants to harm your fun on purpose, likewise, you must not want to spoil anyone's
fun. Consider whether everything you do in game is also fun for other players or
just for you alone.</p>

<?php Page::insert_go_to_top_link(); ?>

<?php Page::cap('I'); ?>
<p>llarion is based on cooperative playing, even if characters may be foes, the
players shall continue the tale of Illarion hand in hand. To battle each other
is in vain, this holds for the Illarion staff, too. It consists of volunteers
that manage a free game in their spare time, without being perfect, just like
you. Respect and common courtesy are as important as good communication; 
helpful word has commonly more effect than a thousand complaints. The staff
does its share to shape the world of Illarion, but the major share is done by
the players. The tales and adventures in the game as well as the way of
communication on the boards and in the chat are influenced by players just like
you. Please contribute actively to maintain an atmosphere of respect and
considerateness that attracts roleplayers from all around the world.</p>

<div class="clr"></div>

<?php Page::insert_go_to_top_link(); ?>

<div><a id="account"></a></div>
<h2>Account</h2>

<p>Every player is allowed only one account. Accounts and characters are not borrowed, 
exchanged or sold. The owner of an account is responsible for all actions of his characters, 
even if an unauthorised person got access to it.</p>

<p>If two players want to log in using the same internet connection, 
they have to inform the Illarion staff about this.
</p>

<?php Page::insert_go_to_top_link(); ?>

<div><a id="names"></a></div>
<h2>Names</h2>

<p>Names of characters have to fit a medieval fantasy world and the race of the
character. In addition, the following types of names are not allowed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Absurd and offensive names (Kismai Ass, Adolf Hitlersson)</li>
  <li>Names of history or present-day life (Barack Obama, Julius Caesar)</li>
  <li>Names of mythology, religion etc. (Buddha, Jesus Christus, Osiris)</li>
  <li>Well known names from literature, TV, movies etc. (Gandalf, Legolas, Harry
  Potter, Mononoke)</li>
  <li>Names containing a title (Sir Yaran, King Kuno). You can add titles in-game
  separately</li>
</ul>

<?php Page::insert_go_to_top_link(); ?>

<div><a id="world"></a></div>
<h2>The game world</h2>

<p>The description of the game world as published on http://www.illarion.org is mandatory. 
The races allowed to play are limited to the races offered to choose during the character 
creation in the account system. It's not allowed to roleplay any mixed-race characters.</p>

<p>
A gamemaster's permission is needed for all magical and divine interventions as well as
supernatural properties that cannot be realised by the engine and affect the game world or
other players.
</p>

<?php Page::insert_go_to_top_link(); ?>

<div><a id="realism"></a></div>
<h2>Realism</h2>

<p>Regardless from the limits and possibilities of the engine one has to adapt
the behaviour of a character to the game world. Swords remain deathly weapons,
ogres are still scary monsters and farming hard labour, even if the engine
allows a player to master such challenges. It is not allowed in the sense of the
game logic to ignore NPCs in your own roleplay. No criminal would rob another
character right in front of a town guard, even if the guard is only a NPC.</p>

<p>Actions of a character must not be adapted to the technical environment of
the engine to maximise success. Characters have to react on external influences
and must not be kept idle in the game. To evade unwanted situations that could
have bad consequences for a character by logging out of the game is
forbidden.</p>

<p>When a character is knocked down or 'killed' (s)he will suffer from injuries
which should be played out. In case of a knock-out there are light injuries, in
the case of death severe ones. The wounds should be played out until the health
points are fully restored.</p>

<?php Page::insert_go_to_top_link(); ?>

<div><a id="charmixing"></a></div>
<h2>Mixing characters</h2>

<p>In general it is not allowed that two characters of one player support each
other. Therefore it is forbidden to exchange items between characters, also not
by using middlemen, and that they share knowledge. One's characters also can't
know each other and cannot be related. It is not allowed at any time to log in
with two characters at the same time.</p>

<?php Page::insert_go_to_top_link(); ?>

<div><a id="ooc"></a></div>
<h2>Out of character (OOC)</h2>

<p>Out of character is everything that is not backed up by actions or thoughts
of a character in-game. Decisions or actions in game should never be motivated by
OOC influence, e.g. because of dislike for the other player. To call for help
via means not present in the game (e.g. messengers) is strictly forbidden. It is
also not allowed to use knowledge which the player has but the character
doesn't. A player has to prove that the character has gained said knowledge.</p>

<?php Page::insert_go_to_top_link(); ?>

<div><a id="language"></a></div>
<h2>Language of characters</h2>

<p>The language should fit the character and the game world and should follow
the rules of spelling and grammar as well as possible. Modern expressions as
well as abbreviations or "Leet-speak" (e.g. "u g0t pwn3d") should not by 
used.</p>

<p>Writing or invoking senseless or disturbing messages and the continuous use
of capital letters to stress statements (e.g. "IT IS MY TURN NOW!") is not
allowed.</p>

<p>Conversations are to be done from the point of view of the character.
Conversations that have nothing to do with the communication between the
characters (OOC) are to kept to a bare minimum and have to be masked by double
brackets (( )) in whisper mode.</p>

<?php Page::insert_go_to_top_link(); ?>

<div><a id="emotes"></a></div>
<h2>Emotes</h2>

<p>Action of characters (e.g. fighting, crafting) should be
accompanied by emotes. Emotes describe only perceivable actions and states.
Emotes do not contain opinions, thoughts or feelings of characters.</p>

<p>So called power-emotes that force a behaviour or an effect on other
characters and leave no room for reaction are forbidden.</p>

<?php Page::insert_go_to_top_link(); ?>

<div><a id="pkilling"></a></div>
<h2>Player killing</h2>

<p>The purposeful attacking of a character without clearly traceable and
reasonable roleplaying reason is forbidden. Immediate killing of a character
right after resurrection ("res-killing") is not allowed.</p>

<?php Page::insert_go_to_top_link(); ?>

<div><a id="harm"></a></div>
<h2>Portrayal of Violence and X-rated Actions</h2>

<p>Content and portrayals of actions which are brutal, perverse, sexual or
glorify violence are strictly forbidden. Also all contents that hurt the ideals
and moralities of involved players and random listeners are not allowed.</p>

<?php Page::insert_go_to_top_link(); ?>

<div><a id="behaivor"></a></div>
<h2>Behaviour</h2>

<p>Harassment, threats or insults, including racist or sexist statements will
not be tolerated. This hold for all platforms of Illarion: The game, the board
and the chat, including private messages.
 It is not allowed to react to a rule violation of another player with another rule violation 
(e.g. OOC-messages). These breaches will be dealt with, regardless of the situation. 
It is unwanted that players blame each other for rule violations. If an unbearable rule violation
 occurs, the Illarion staff should be informed to process the case.</p>

<?php Page::insert_go_to_top_link(); ?>

<div><a id="rulebreak"></a></div>
<h2>Reaction to rule violations</h2>

<p>It is not allowed to react to a rule violation of another player with another
rule violation (e.g. OOC-messages). These breaches will be dealt with,
regardless of the situation. It is unwanted that players blame each other for
rule violations. If a rule violation occurs, the Illarion staff should be
informed to process the case.</p>

<?php Page::insert_go_to_top_link(); ?>

<div><a id="bugs"></a></div>
<h2>Bug exploits</h2>

<p>The wilful use of game errors (bugs) is, regardless of reason, forbidden. If
an error is found in-game, it has to be reported to the Illarion staff;
preferably by an entry in the bugtracker. If items or effects are lost due to a
bug or server crash, there is no replacement or refund.</p>

<?php Page::insert_go_to_top_link(); ?>

<div><a id="gms"></a></div>
<h2>Gamemasters</h2>

<p>Gamemasters help players, host events and keep the peace in the game.
Gamemasters also run the ingame factions of Cadomyr, Galmair and Runewick.
Thus, all requests that affect the game world should be directed to them.</p>

<?php Page::insert_go_to_top_link(); ?>

<div><a id="boards"></a></div>
<h2>Board</h2>

<p>On the Illarion forums, the rules apply analogously. Creating senseless or
off-topic posts is not allowed.</p>

<?php Page::insert_go_to_top_link(); ?>

<div><a id="macros"></a></div>
<h2>Additional programs</h2>

<p>The usage of programs which influence the behaviour of the game and thus
offer an advantage to the player are not allowed.</p>

<?php Page::insert_go_to_top_link(); ?>
