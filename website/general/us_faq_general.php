		<p> </p>
		
	<li class="question"><a id="gs3"></a><strong>What are the system requirements for Illarion?</strong></li>

	    <p>You can review the system requirements on the <a href="http://illarion.org/illarion/us_java_download.php">download page of the website</a>. Illarion is a cross platform game that runs on Windows, Linux and MacOS. Some operation systems like Windows Vista do not support the free graphics standard OpenGL by default. Make sure that you have the latest drivers installed for your graphics adapter.</p>

During the setup, you will be prompted to choose a directory to store your character relevant data. It would be advised to store them in a folder you can easily find afterwards.</p>

	<h2>First Steps Into Illarion</h2>

<ul>
	<li class="question"><a id="fs1"></a><strong>I just started playing and don't know what to do!</strong></li>
		
		<p>There is a tutorial that will guide you through your first minutes of the game, Afterwards you're free to do whatever you like. You could become a proud Knight, a dedicated Priest, an industrious Crafter, a prudent Druid or a mysterious Mage.</p>

	<li class="question"><a id="fs2"></a><strong>How can I attack and kill somebody?</strong></li>
	
		<p>You can either right click on a character or monster and choose "Attack", or you can hold down CTRL and left click the character or monster. Please respect that it is only allowed to attack other characters when there is a valid role play reason to do so. You should also give your target the chance to interact before and during a fight. Emotes that show your character drawing his or her weapon, or moving in an intimidating fashion to another character are appreciated.</p>
		

	<li class="question"><a id="fs3"></a><strong>How do I pick up items?</strong></li>
		
		<p>You may move the item by "Dragging and Dropping" it to a free place in your inventory. This process is similar to the way icons are moved on Windows/Linux/MacOS-desktops. Your inventory is composed of your character's clothing (which is the spaces on top of the image of a man), the belt (which is the six spaces under your character's clothing/armour) and a bag. The bag must be worn and can be opened to be able to use it. If you want to open the bag of your character, perform a double click or press 'B'.</p>

		
	<li class="question"><a id="fs4"></a><strong>How do I use or equip items?</strong></li>
	
		<p>To equip an item, move the item you want to equip to a free slot in your inventory (the 'man' at the right of the screen). If you hold your mouse over a slot it shows you what you can put here. The slot has to be free to put something new in it. To do this, move the previous item somewhere else (e.g in the bag of your character). This works for weapons, armour or anything else you wear. If you want to use an item (e.g. eating an apple), right click and choose "Use". Alternatively you can hold SHIFT and click the item and release.</p>

	<li class="question"><a id="fs5"></a><strong>How does crafting work in this game?</strong></li>
		
		<p></p>

	<li class="question"><a id="fs6"></a><strong>What about magic? How can I cast spells?</strong></li>
		
		<p></p>
		
	<li class="question"><a id="fs7"></a><strong>What faction should I chose?</strong></li>
		
		<p></p>
		
	<li class="question"><a id="fs8"></a><strong>Does the game have storage facilities?</strong></li>
		
		<p>Yes. The game uses a "depot" system. These are yellow storage boxes scattered around key areas of towns. To use them, move next to them and "open" them as you would a bag, you can then drag and drop any items you wish to store into the depot.</p>
		
	<li class="question"><a id="fs9"></a><strong>I died! How do I resurrect? Is there a death penalty?</strong></li>

	<h2>Game Concepts</h2>

<ul>
	<li class="question"><a id="gc1"></a><strong>What is an RPG and what makes Illarion special?</strong></li>
	
		<p>Role playing games (RPG) are a popular game genre. Players take on the role of a fantasy character and are able to do many things that may be impossible in Real Life. Illarion takes the concept of Role playing further than other games, players are expected to immerse themselves completely into the life of their character. Whilst playing Illarion you cease to be John/Jane Smith from New York and instead take on the role of a fictional character by feeling, saying, and thinking what he or she would. Illarion is set in a medieval world with no electricity, cars, televisions or power tools. Whilst playing you are expected to refrain from mentioning anything Out Of Character (OOC).</p>
		

	<li class="question"><a id="gc2"></a><strong>What are CMs and GMs?</strong></li>
	
		<p>A CM is a Community Manager. Their role is to assist new players and help resolve issues or conflicts between players. They should be the first people to turn to in the event of a non-technical issue. A GM is a Game Master. The GMs provide dynamic content (quests, events, etc) as well as upholding the rules of Illarion.</p>
		

	<li class="question"><a id="gc3"></a><strong>Why do some of the players talk funny?</strong></li>
		
		<p>First of all, Illarion is played by players from all around the world. So it's no wonder that they don't speak the same language. English and German are the most common languages and it is a matter of courtesy to switch language to a language commonly understood when encountering other players. Special dialects could be applied as well. Most players try to make their characters sound medieval without using Old English as many people would struggle to understand. Abbreviations and chat slang are also against the rules. Take your time using capital letters and punctuation marks too.<BR> Bad Example: "ok hi wanna buy sword lol!!!111"<BR> Good Example: "Greetings, noble sir. May I draw your attention on this well crafted blade, a blade I'd like to offer to you for a reasonable price?"</p>
		

	<li class="question"><a id="gc4"></a><strong>How do I find out an item's stats?</strong></li>

		<p></p>	

	<li class="question"><a id="gc5"></a><strong>Where can I see my skill levels?</strong></li>

		<p></p>	

	<li class="question"><a id="gc6"></a><strong>How do I send global chat messages?</strong></li>
	
		 <p>We might grant powerful mages a special ability to communicate by telepathy, but nothing is planned yet. If you need to spread a message, you can always hire another player as a messenger or use the <a href="http://illarion.org/community/forums/index.php">Forums</a> to leave messages on the town walls.</p>
